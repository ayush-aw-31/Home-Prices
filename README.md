# Home-Prices
Real Estate Price Prediction Website
This data science project series guides you through the step-by-step process of building a real estate price prediction website. We start by creating a predictive model using sklearn and linear regression, utilizing the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle. Next, we develop a Python Flask server to handle HTTP requests and return predicted prices.

Throughout the project, we cover a wide range of data science concepts, including data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV, and k-fold cross-validation.

Technologies and Tools:

Python
Numpy and Pandas: Data cleaning
Matplotlib: Data visualization
Sklearn: Model building
Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm: IDEs
Python Flask: HTTP server
